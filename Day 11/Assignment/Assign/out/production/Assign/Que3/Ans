Abstract Class :
1. Abstract class can have unimplemented function (abstract func) as well as implemented func.
2. A class must be declared abstract class, if all inherited abstract methods are not implemented.
3. Abstract Class represents partial abstraction.
4. Abstract Class cannot inherit multiple abstract class.
5. Abstracts Class extends another Abstracts Class.
6. Multiple Inheritance not possible.

Interface
1. Interface contains only unimplemented methods. From java 1.8, we can include default and static methods.
2. In implemented class all unimplemented methods must be overridden.
3. Interface represents full abstraction.
4. Interface can extends multiple interfaces.
5. Classes implements interfaces, and interfaces extends other interfaces.
6. Multiple Inheritance is possible.
